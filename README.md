### Surface

#### Data Base Design
The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) shows how the database is organized at the heart of the site's features.

![ERD Diagram](/static/docs/drawsql-the-pastry-hub-erd.png)

**User Model:** Django provides a User Model, which serves as the foundation for user accounts on the platform. Users can register and manage their profiles using this model.

**Recipe Model:** The Recipe Model is the heart of the platform, allowing users to create, store, and share their pastry recipes. Each user has the flexibility to add multiple recipes, each with its own unique details. These details include the recipe's title, author, estimated baking time, step-by-step instructions, a list of ingredients, an image to visually represent the dish, image alt text for accessibility, the recipe's status (such as published or draft), and the date it was posted.

**FavoriteRecipe Model:** Users can add their favorite recipes to the FavoriteRecipe Model. This model establishes a relationship between users and the recipes they adore. It provides a means for users to curate their personal collection of beloved recipes.

 **Future Models:**

In the pipeline for future development is the **Comment model**. This feature will enhance the interactive aspect of the platform by allowing users to leave comments on recipes. It will foster a sense of community among users, encouraging discussions, feedback, and shared experiences related to the culinary delights created and enjoyed by the community.

#### Colours
I wanted the page to have an inviting and playful feel that reflects the deliciousness of the recipes. However, I didn't want the colors to be too overpowering, considering the page contains numerous images of various pastries.

![Colour palette](/static/docs/colours.png)

#### Typography
I used DM Sans font To make The Pastry Hub visually appealing and easy to read. My goal was to create a pleasant and easy-to-read text style that goes well with the overall design.

#### Logo
I created a simple logo for The Pastry Hub to strengthen its visual identity. The logo is minimalistic and easy to understand, making it easier for users to recognize and associate with The Pastry Hub.

### Sprints
The project adopted an Agile development approach, breaking down the development process into several sprints. Each sprint had a specific focus and objectives:

**Sprint 1: Project Installation and Configuration (Oct 2 - Oct 3, 2023)**

In the first sprint, the project commenced with the basic installation and configuration of components. This involved setting up views, templates, and connecting URLs, as well as registering models, establishing the foundational structure of the project.

**Sprint 2: Interface Design and User Story Templates (Oct 6 - Oct 10, 2023)**

The second sprint focused on designing the interface for the website, with a specific emphasis on login, logout, and registration pages. User management systems were integrated, enhancing the user experience.

**Sprint 3: Recipe-Related Functionality and User Interface (Oct 13 - Oct 17, 2023)**

Sprint 3 included the implementation of critical recipe-related functionality, such as the ability to delete and update recipes. A new model for favorite recipes was added, and a new template to display detailed recipe information was created.

**Sprint 4: UI Enhancements, User Experience, and Style Improvements (Oct 20 - Oct 30, 2023)**

In the fourth sprint, work was focused on improving the user interface and overall user experience. This included creating an appealing hero section with content and making minor adjustments to enhance usability.

**Sprint 5: Testing, Final Code Revisions, and Documentation (Oct 30 - Nov 7, 2023)**

The final sprint centered on testing the code and conducting final revisions. Project documentation was completed, and the last refinements were made to ensure the project's quality and completeness.

## Conclusion

The Pastry Hub is a web application that I designed for pastry enthusiasts to share their favorite recipes and connect with like-minded bakers. I am delighted to share that it successfully achieved its goals, offering user-friendly features like registration and recipe management.

Agile development was the cornerstone of this project's success. Breaking down tasks into sprints allowed for a structured and organized workflow. The iterative nature of Agile enabled continuous improvement based on user feedback and evolving requirements, resulting in a more user-friendly application.

Looking forward, I aim to enhance user engagement with features like a comment section, password reset, and account deletion. The Pastry Hub is a community that invites all baking enthusiasts to come together, celebrate their passion, and share delightful recipes.

## Deployment & Development

### Deploy on Heroku

**To deploy your project on Heroku, follow these steps:**

**Step 1: Preparing Files**

Before you start, you need two essential files: `requirements.txt` and `Procfile`.

- Create `requirements.txt` by running this command in your terminal: `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`. This file will list all the requirements.
- Next, create a file named `Procfile` and add the line: `web: gunicorn pastryhub.wsgi` to it, without any empty lines. Make sure to push both these files to your repository.

**Step 2: Creating a Heroku App**

- Log in to Heroku and go to the Dashboard.
- Click "New" and select "Create new app."
- Give your app a name and choose the region closest to you.
- Click "Create app" to confirm.

**Step 3: Setting Up a Database**

- Log in to ElephantSQL.com and access your dashboard.
- Click "Create New Instance."
- Choose a plan, give it a name, select the Tiny Turtel (Free) plan, and leave the Tags field blank.
- Select a data center near you.
- Click "Review" and confirm your details.
- Return to the ElephantSQL dashboard and click on the database instance name for your project.
- In the URL section, copy the database URL.
- Ensure that Django and Gunicorn are installed in your workspace using `pip3 install 'django<4' gunicorn`.
- Also, make sure the database infrastructure is installed by running `pip3 install dj_database_url===0.5.0 psycopg2`.
- Update the `requirements.txt` file if necessary.

**Step 4: The env.py File**

- Create an `env.py` file if you don't already have one and make sure it's included in the .gitignore file.
In the `env.py` file, add the following lines:

`import os` <br>
`os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "<copied URL from SQL database>"` <br>
`os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "<create a secret key of your own>"` <br>

- If you're using Cloudinary storage, add this line as well:

`os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = "<copied URL from Cloudinary account>"`<br>

Ensure that the environment variables are correctly imported into the `settings.py` file.

**Step 5: Setting Environment Variables on Heroku**

- On the Heroku Dashboard, select the app you created and then go to the "Settings" tab.
- Click "Reveal Config Vars."
- Add the following config vars:
* `DATABASE_URL` (copy the database URL from ElephantSQL).
* `SECRET_KEY` (copy your secret key).
- If you're using Cloudinary storage, add your personal `CLOUDINARY_URL` to these fields. Additionally, you may need the key `PORT` with a value of `8000`.

**Step 6: Connecting to GitHub and Deployment**

- On the Heroku Dashboard, select your app and go to the "Deploy" tab.
- Choose GitHub as the deployment method.
- Search for your project repository and click "Connect."
- If desired, enable automatic deploys.
- Finally, select "Deploy Branch" to watch your app being built and deployed.

### Forking the Repository

- Log in to GitHub and find the repository you want to fork.
- Above the "Settings" Tab, click the "Fork" button.
- You now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account, allowing you to make changes while keeping the original safe.

### Making a Local Clone

- Log in to GitHub and locate the repository you want to clone.
- Click the 'Code' dropdown above the file list.
- Copy the URL for the repository.
- Open Git Bash in your IDE.
- Change the current working directory to where you want the cloned directory.
- Type `git clone` in the CLI and then paste the URL you copied. It should look like this: `$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository`
- Press Enter to create your local clone.
- Don't forget to install all the required packages listed in the requirements.txt file using the command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This command will install them for you.
