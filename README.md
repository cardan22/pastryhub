## About
The Pastry Hub is a website where you can share your favorite pastry recipes. Each recipe tells you how to make delicious pastries. You can create an account to add, change, or remove your recipes anytime. It's a friendly place for people who enjoy baking sweet treats to connect and share their best recipes with each other.

### Project goals
The goal of the project was to build a user-friendly platform where you can easily upload and share your favorite recipes. It also lets you make your own special recipe collection, so you can easily gather and organize your favorite recipes for sharing and easy access. You can create your account, and that allows you to add, change, or remove your recipes whenever you want.

The application was created with a focus on the Five Planes of User Experience.

I used DM Sans font To make The Pastry Hub visually appealing and easy to read. My goal was to create a pleasant and easy-to-read text style that goes well with the overall design.
